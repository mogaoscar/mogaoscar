- 👋 Hi, I’m @mogaoscar, I'm an Aerospace Engineering student working as QA at an electronics company!
- 👀 I’m interested in software developing both for work and especially to make my own projects for fun!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning python and c++, working with 3rd party libraries and generating cross-platform distributable executables.
- 🌱 I'm looking to learn GUI programming on Flutter to step outside the terminal and make my Apps!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on popular community Flutter packages that I've used, to make them even better and bug free!
- 📫 You can reach me at mogaoscar@gmail.com!
